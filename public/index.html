      <h2>Why I love Yoga</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga is a form of therapy to me. When you show up on the mat, you are
        giving yourself the gift of getting to know your body in an extremely
        intimate way.

      <h2>Forms of Yoga</h2>
      <p>
        There are many forms of yoga and everyone will like something a
        different. Also, every teacher has a different style so people should
        try more than one teach for each style to see if they find someone or a
        form they like most.
